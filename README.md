#### What is Bodine?
This is a writing tool. Press a hotkey and you can get:
- searches a phrase on Google Books for the number of results
- finds synonyms in context and gets their respective number of results
- context wildcard searching (i.e. "what you see is what you *")
- examples of usage
- historical data of phrase

This is in early beta with a barely functional GUI. If you like shabby software, this is for you!
#### Todo
