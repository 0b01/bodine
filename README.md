#### What is Bodine?
Bodine is a writing tool. Select a phrase, Press a hotkey and it does the following:
- searches selection on Google Books for correctness
- finds synonyms in context and gets their respective correctness using Google books
- matches wildcard in context (i.e. "what you see is what you *")
- returns examples
- shows historical usage

This is in early beta with a barely functional GUI. If you like shabby software, you should consider downloading it. More to come. 
#### Todo
- [x] GUI
- [ ] Select Google Books API by subject/genre
- [x] Incorporate Google Web API
- [x] Synonyms using Textblob library
- [ ] ??? Google N-grams View
- [x] sub it's -> it is
- [x] Part-of-Speech Tagging
